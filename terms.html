		<h2>What you need to know</h2>
		<p class="bold">Effective 4th February 2015</p>

		<h3>Acceptance of Terms</h3>
		<p>This Terms of Service document is an agreement (the “Agreement”) that you must accept in order to use the Documize Service (“Documize,” the “Documize Service,” the “Service,” the “Software” or the “Site,” as described below). It is applicable to (a) “Owners” -- this includes Primary Owners who initially set up the Documize Service and other users who are granted ownership privileges by the Primary Owner; (b) Administrators – those who manage a Documize Account and to c) Members – users who are invited to join an existing Documize account that has already been created by an Administrator (“Member” or “Members”). The terms “You” and “users” encompass all users, including both Administrative and Members. This document describes both your rights and your obligations as part of using the Service. It is important that you read it carefully because you will be legally bound to these terms. Documize Limited (“Documize” “Documize Limited” “we” “us”) only provides the Service to you subject to this Agreement. By accepting this Agreement or by accessing or using the Service or Site, you acknowledge that you agree to be bound by this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference).</p>
		<p>If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or business, you represent that you have the authority to bind such entity, its Employees, Representatives, and Affiliates to this Agreement. In this Agreement the terms “you” or “your” shall also refer to such entity, its Employees, Representatives and Affiliates as applicable. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with this Terms Of Service, you may not use the Service. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and Documize Limited, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you and Documize Limited, and it governs your use of the Service.</p>

		<h3>Changes to the Terms of Service</h3>
		<p>You agree that Documize Limited may change this Agreement. If such changes are material we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the changes by emailing the email address associated with your account or by posting a notice on the Site. You can download and review the most current version of the Agreement at any time by visiting this page. The revised terms and conditions will become effective on the date set forth in our notice, and if you use the Service after that date, your use will constitute acceptance of the revised terms and conditions. If any change to the Terms Of Service is not acceptable to you, your only remedy is to cancel your account and stop using the Services, which you must do through the process provided in the Service.</p>

		<h3>Use of the Service</h3>
		<p>As part of the registration process, you will identify an administrative user name (in the form of an email address) and password for your account. You may use these credentials to invite individuals to become Members (each with their own unique email address and password) under your account. The number of Members and the rights pertaining to membership are limited to the maximum number of members with differing permissions permitted for your account and based upon the plan you purchase or which is provided for you at no cost by Documize Limited. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login, password, and account and for all activities that occur under your login or account, including the activities of Members.</p>
		<p>Members should be aware that your company’s Administrative Users may have certain rights to access your account and may obtain related information in connection with the Services. The Administrator also sets your company’s policies regarding the use of the Services. Please see our refer to your company Administrator if you have any questions regarding your account, particularly with regard to permissions to upload, edit, label and delete documents.</p>
		<p>By accessing or using the Services, you affirm that you are at least 18 years of age (or have reached the age of majority if that is not 18 years of age where you live). You represent that you are fully able and competent to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Documize is not directed to anyone under the age of 15 so if you are under the age of 15 you are not permitted to access or use the Services. If we become aware that you are using Documize and are under the age of 15 we will deactivate your account and reserve the right to delete all information in it.</p>
		<p>If you are a school or teacher and want your students, who are over 15, to use Documize, you agree that you are responsible for complying with all governmental statutory requirements relating to such access in the territory in which you are located and that you must notify those students’ parents/guardians of the personally identifiable information you will collect and share with Documize and obtain parental/guardian consent before your students establish accounts or use the Service. When obtaining such consent, you should provide parents/guardians with a copy of our Privacy Policy. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.</p>

		<h3>Description of Service</h3>
		<p>The “Service(s)” include the website https://documize.com, and our related mobile applications, and all software, applications, data, reports, text, images, and other content made available through any of the foregoing.</p>

		<h3>Your Data Rights and Related Responsibilities</h3>
		<p>"Your Data" means any data and content stored or transmitted via the Services by or on behalf of you or your end users (which may include data you elect to import from third party services you use). "Content" includes messages you send, files you upload, comments on files, profile information and anything else you enter or upload into Documize. Documize Limited will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all facilities used to store and process Your Data meet a high standard for security (for more information on our current practices and policies regarding data privacy, security and confidentiality, please see https://documize.com/security; we shall keep that document updated as best practice and security policies evolve over time).</p>
		<p>In order for us to provide the Service to you, we require that you grant us certain rights with respect to Your Data. For example, we need to be able to transmit, store and copy Your Data in order to display it to you and your teammates, to index it so you are able to search it, to make backups to prevent data loss, and so on. Your acceptance of this Terms of Service gives us the permission to do so and grants us all rights necessary to provide the service to you for the purpose of providing the service (and for no other purpose). This permission includes allowing us to use third-party service providers (such as Amazon Web Services) in the operation and administration of the service and the rights granted to us are extended to these third parties to the degree necessary in order for the service to be provided. These rights and permissions are not permanent: they terminate whenever you remove Your Data from The Service. We claim no ownership over Your Data.</p>
		<p>If you or your end users send us any feedback or suggestions regarding the Service, you grant Documize Limited an unlimited, irrevocable, free license to use any such feedback or suggestions for any purpose without any obligation to you or your end users.</p>
		<p>You are solely responsible for your, your administrators’ and your end users’ conduct, the content of Your Data, and all communications with others while using the Services. We may choose to review public content for compliance with our policies and guidelines, but you acknowledge that Documize Limited has no obligation to monitor any information on the Services. However, you further agree that Documize Limited may remove or disable any public content at any time for any reason or for no reason at all. For example, if you upload files which do not belong to you and make these files available publicly, we can delete those files. We are not responsible for the accuracy, appropriateness, or legality of Your Data or any other information you and your end users may be able to access using the Services. The Services provide features that allow you and your end users to share Your Data and other materials with others or to make it public. Please consider carefully what you allow to be shared or made public.</p>

		<h3>Fair Usage Policy</h3>
		<p>Documize wants all of its customers to get the best experience of the Service. Our Fair Usage Policy ("FUP") is designed to prevent abuse of our subscriptions by a small number of users to the detriment of other. As a result of automated usage analysis of accounts that are provided to you free or as part of a fixed term promotion, our Fair Usage Policy may result in the disabling of your account if the volume of data stored against it (including data loaded by any members of your account) exceeds one (1) Gigabyte in volume. If your account is a paid account then our Fair Usage policy will restrict you to one hundred (100) Gigabytes of data unless you have a specific, written agreement with us that alters this value.</p>
		<p>We will always notify you before taking action to restrict your access to the system as a result of a breach of the FUP and give you the opportunity to take remedial action on your account.</p>

		<h3>Application URL / Domain</h3>
		<p>We reserve the right to change the service domain / sub-domain / URL that you selected or were otherwise allocated.</p>
		<p>Where possible, you will be notified before the change in domain.</p>

		<h3>Payment</h3>
		<p>To the extent any portion of the Service is made available for a fee, you will be required to select a payment plan and provide Documize Limited accurate information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You will promptly update your account information with any changes in your payment information. You agree to pay Documize Limited the amount that is specified in the applicable payment plan in accordance with the terms set forth in the Service and this Agreement, and you authorize Documize Limited to bill your payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with such terms.</p>
		<p>If you dispute any charges you must let Documize Limited know within thirty (30) days after the date that Documize Limited invoices you. All amounts paid are non-refundable and we reserve the right to change our prices in the future. If we do change prices, we will provide notice of the change on the Site and in email to you at least 30 days before the change is to take effect. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. Documize Limited may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full payment for invoices issued must be received by the specified date or the Services may be terminated. Unpaid invoices are subject to a finance charge of 1.5% per month on any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower, plus all expenses of collection. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with Services other than taxes based on Documize Limited’s net income.</p>

Further, you understand that Your Data may be transmitted or handled in an unencrypted manner if you choose to use unencrypted gateways to connect to the Service.
