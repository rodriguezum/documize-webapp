	<h2>What you need to know</h2>
	<p class="bold">Effective 7th February 2015</p>

	<p>Documize Limited (“Documize”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to our Website (documize.com) and our Subscription Service (the “Service”), including our associated mobile application (“Documize App”). This Privacy Policy governs our data collection, processing and usage practices. By using our Website or Service you consent to the data practices described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree with the data practices described in this Privacy Policy, you should not use the Website or the Service.</p>

	<p>We periodically update this Privacy Policy. If you are a subscriber to the Service then you will receive notice when this Privacy Policy is modified. The notice will be delivered through the Website and by email to the account of the primary owner of the Service account. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>

	<h3>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
	<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a new version online. You should check this page occasionally to review any changes. If we make any material changes we will notify you by posting the revised Privacy Policy on our Websites and, if you subscribe to our Service, via email to the primary owner of the Subscription Service account. This Privacy Policy helps you to always be aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed.
